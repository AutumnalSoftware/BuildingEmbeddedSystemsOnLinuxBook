# BuildingEmbeddedSystemsOnLinuxBook

About This Repository

This repository contains companion code for Building Embedded Systems on Linux: A Modern C++ Approach.

The code here is intended to support released chapters only. During writing, I may push intermediate or experimental code that does not yet correspond directly to published text. When that happens, the book should be considered the authoritative reference.

Code will be updated and refined as new chapters are released.

Note: This repository may contain work-in-progress code ahead of the current published chapters.
